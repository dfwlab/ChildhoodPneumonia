Methodological information:

Our study used an electronic medical record system to collect data for retrospective analysis. Our data were recorded by attending nurses and doctors at the time of the patient's presentation to the emergency department (ED). The demographic characteristics of each patient including comorbidities were reviewed thoroughly. We collected the patients' worst vital signs, laboratory results, ventilator support, and use of pressors within 24 hours of admission before initiation of ICU treatment. Score scales were used to calculate the relevant parameters of patients at admission, including APACHE2, SOFA, Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), and CURB-65(a 5-point score based on confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age ≥65). Duration of fever, infection markers, respiratory management, and Sepsis medication was recorded during ICU treatment. Pathogenic microorganisms and subsequent antibiotic use of CAP were also collected.



Data-specific information:

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 119 patients with SCAP who were treated in the Integrated ICU of The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University (a comprehensive tertiary adult hospital) from 1 January 2018 to 30 December 2020. The observation endpoint was 180-day mortality.
