# Assessing Severe Pneumonia Risk in Children via Clinical Prognostic Model Based on Laboratory Markers

## Introduction
The primary objective of this study is to develop a XGBoost model for clinical laboratory test data that will assist doctors in making diagnoses and prescribing treatments, and that will also improve the prognosis and survival time of children with severe pneumonia.

## Data

* Data from PIC database ([https://physionet.org/content/picdb/1.1.0/](https://physionet.org/content/picdb/1.1.0/)), which is a large paediatric-specific, single-center, bilingual database comprising information relating to children admitted to critical care units at  the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine.

* Validation data
Validation data from pediatric patients under 3 years with severe pneumonia admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University in 2019.
